# What is LoveMilkTea?

[LoveMilKTea](https://devpost.com/software/ho-okele) is a cross platform mobile application built during the month long [Honolulu Annual Code Challenge](http://hacc.hawaii.gov/). With the help of my team, we took first place createing a mobile wayfaring guide for the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

# The Challenge

Garret Yoshimi, the vice president of ITS pitched his idea for a wayfaring guide for the University. We knew the university had a map with points of many of the buildings of the campus but it was not easily accessible, did not have every point of interest, and most importantly of all it was not mobile friendly. We wanted to provide the students of the University with a complete mobile friendly application that provides information, directions and much more.

# How we Built our Application

The basis of our application was built using [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/), which is a cross-platform HTML framework. Not only is it built as a web application but it was easily ported for Android and iOS devices. Since the Universty of Hawaii is a Google school, we decided to use Google's [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as our backend technology. The document driven nature of Firebase made it extremely fast and easy to use. The scalabiltiy of Firebase also ensures that our application is here to stay for the future.

## What Have I Learned?

I have gained a lot of valuable knowledge by participating in the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge. One of the most valuable skills I learned by getting familiarized with Google Maps JavaScript API. In my opinion becoming familiar with a helpful API such as Google Maps is a very strong skill to have. Especially because maps are useful, everyone loves maps.

Another valuable skill I learned was working with backends. I benefited a lot from working with Google's Firebase. I learned how to efficiently use their REST API, secure API keys and data, and organize backend data efficiently.
