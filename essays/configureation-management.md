## Configuration Management Practices

I think most people would agree that they are not the most organized people. I can't lie I'm definitely not the most organized person either. That is why I believe
configuration management to be a really important tool/thing to learn. Without proper documentation and configuration management practices a person can easily be lost
in files and forget where their files are and the time spent trying to find files can add up rather quickly and delay your project or assignment by a lot.

## Git
Git is an example of a configuration management platform. It's a powerful platform that allows many people to collaborate on a project from a remote location. It also
allows people to work on assignments of projects without getting in the way of other people's work. For example if two people want to work on the same file at the same time,
they can actually do it without overwtiting each other's work. Then they can compare who's work can be better and save previous versions of their work.
