## Configuration Management Practices

I think most people would agree that they are not the most organized people. I can't lie I'm definitely not the most organized person either. That is why I believe
configuration management to be a really important tool/thing to learn. Without proper documentation and configuration management practices a person can easily be lost
in files and forget where their files are and the time spent trying to find files can add up rather quickly and delay your project or assignment by a lot.
