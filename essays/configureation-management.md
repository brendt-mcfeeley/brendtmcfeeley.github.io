## Disorganized Mess

I think most people would agree that they are not the most organized people. I can't lie I'm definitely not the most organized person either. That is why I believe configuration management to be a really important tool to learn. Without proper documentation and configuration management practices a person can easily lose files and forget where their files are and the time spent trying to find files can add up rather quickly and delay your project or assignment by a lot. 

In my ICS 212 class, we were writing projects with around 750-1500 lines of code spread across multiple files. I did not use a configuration management tool like SCCS (Source Code Control System) or Git. I constantly changed code all the time and then got lost when something did not work. My solution to this was to create "test" files where I copied the code, edited it and copied it back into my original file. I got lost really fast because I suddenly had to browse through at least 10+ different files.

## Git and GitHub
Git is an example of a revision control system. It manages your source code history. It is similar to SCCS where it can save previous versions of your code so you can refer back to it later if your new version does not work. It also allows you to collaborate with other people so you can all edit your own versions of the code and document the changes that happened. GitHub on the other hand is a service that hosts Git repositories. It is a configuration management system because you can share your repositores/code with others, access other users repositories, and store local copies of data.

## Which made which more popular? The Git chicken or the GitHub egg?

I believe that GitHub is popular because of git. Git was created to share repositories between several people. On the other hand GitHub is very popular because now people can share repositores between people all around the world. You would have to add every single person to a single Git in order to share a repository globally but now it can be done all in one place using GitHub.
