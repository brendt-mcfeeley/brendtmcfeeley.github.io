## How I Felt Towards Meteor At First

The image above accurately reflects on how I felt when I first started using [MeteorJS](https://www.meteor.com/). The very first time we were introduced to Meteor, I was super overwelmed by all the templating, routing, client, and server side shenanigans. I might have actually thought that a meteor was headed straight at me. Initially I was really scared to do the WODs because I was really uncomfortable with using Meteor. I was scared that I was going to DNF and have it negatively affect my grade. But eventually as time went on, I naturally became more confident and comfortable using Meteor! One of the biggest reasons I became comfortable using Meteor was using it at the [AT&T Hackathon](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/2017/01/att-mobile-app-hackathon-2017-hawaii/) in March 2017. Although my team ghetto-esque inserted scripts everywhere and didn't subscribe to certain databases correctly, I was still able to learn a lot about Meteor within those 24 hours.

## Things Got Easier.. With Time

As previously stated I was becoming a lot more confident and comfortable with Meteor. I like to think of it as a growing tree. The more time goes on the more you grow and understand. That didn't make a lot of sense compared to a tree but you can kind of imagine it. To me the easiest things about Meteor is routing pages and linking them all together. I know it isn't a very hard thing to do but it is a very **crucial** thing to be able to know. Having multiple pages is one of the core parts of a web application or website. Also I find the fact that you can easily use HTML/CSS frameworks and JavaScript librabries combined with IntelliJ and GitHub to be really useful. To be able to see your web application project update in real time and also be able to commit changes on the fly made developing applications so much easier.

## Dificulties? Definitely.
