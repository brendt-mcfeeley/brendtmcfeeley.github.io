## How I Felt Towards Meteor At First

The image above accurately reflects on how I felt when I first started using (MeteorJS)[https://www.meteor.com/]. The very first time we were introduced to Meteor, I was super overwelmed by all the templating, routing, client, and server side shenanigans. Initially I was really scared to do the WODs because I was really uncomfortable with using Meteor. I was scared that I was going to DNF and have it negatively affect my grade. But eventually as time went on, I naturally became more confident and comfortable using Meteor! One of the biggest reasons I became comfortable using Meteor was using it at the AT&T Hackathon in March 2017. Although my team ghetto-esque inserted scripts everywhere and didn't subscribe to certain databases correctly, I was still able to learn a lot about Meteor within those 24 hours.
