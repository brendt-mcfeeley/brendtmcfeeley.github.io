### They're both sharp!

## What is a UI Framework?

First of all, what is a UI Framework? UI stands for user interface and a UI Framework is a software tool to help you build a website that looks like a real website. There are many different frameworks such as [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).

It won't do much if I just explain to you what a UI Framework is, visual examples are the easiest way to explain what UI Frameworks do.

For example, on the left is an example of a website built purely with HTML & CSS. Next to it there is an example of a website built using Semantic UI.

What's the first thing that comes to your mind? Probably that the website on the right is more visually appealing. Not because it has more colors or whatnot, but because it's organization and structure is a lot more modern and what you expect to see on a website now days.

## Why do websites need to be visually appealing?

According to research such as [this](https://research.googleblog.com/2012/08/users-love-simple-and-familiar-designs.html) one done by Google, your website needs to make a great first impression just like how you need to make a first great impression in real life. According to the study the average user takes only 50 miliseconds (0.05 seconds!) to decide whether they want to stay on the website. And according to the research :
>This first impression depends on many factors: structure, colors, spacing, symmetry, amount of text, fonts, and more.

What do websties built with frameworks and the research have in common? The websites built with frameworks have all those things! While sites built with raw HTML & CSS look like they're from the 90's and have no personaility. And you definitely do not want people to be clicking away from your site, that completely defeats the purpose of a website.

## Benefits of using a framework

The benefits of using a framework are quite apparent. Your websites turn out visually appealing which is very important. They look modern and they convey the subconcious thought that someone put a lot of work into the website (which is true, it takes a lot of time to make a website look amazing). You can easily organize a website with various headers, footers, containers, grids, lists, and more. An organized website makes a user happy. Do you remember a time when you came in contact with an unorganized website? You probably wanted nothing more to do with it and just exit out of it. 

Also since frameworks include both HTML and CSS elements you also learn the language at the same time as learning the syntax of the framework! You kill two birds with one stone. Also have you ever heard a designer complain about a client saying "MAKE SOMETHING THAT POPS!!!". Well now you know where to start. Instantly applying a framework to a website makes it "pop" and stand out from a website that was made from raw HTML and CSS.

## Disadvantages of using a framework (the bad)

Now with most good things there has to be a bad side. One bad thing about learning frameworks is that at first they seem imtimidating and hard to use. So far in my experience this is true. The only way to be comfortable using a framework is to just jump in and play around with all the different classes and what they do. There is no other way around it because you have to see how the elements of the framework interact with each other and display on screen. The second bad thing about using a framework is that it takes a lot of creativity. You could just copy a websites design and call it a day but then what are you really learning? The process of learning a framework also includes a creativity aspect. Certain websites would look better with certain layouts and if you can't visiualize the layout in your head you will have a very hard time building the website.
