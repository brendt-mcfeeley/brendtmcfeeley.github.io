## Learning JavaScript

I started my coding adventure when I was in high school using tools such as CodeCademy learning simple languages like JavaScript and HTML. The languages that I am familar with are Java, C, and C++. Initially JavaScript looked similar to the other object oriented programming languages such as Java and C++ but I quickly learned that it was really different. I was having trouble learning the basics of JavaScript through [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) because of the small syntax differences.


For example in Java, C, and C++, declaring a variable is intuitive :

```
int x = 50;

float y = 40.5;

char z[5] = "hi" ;

```

But in JavaScript you only have three declaration types for all variables :

```
var intX = 50;

let y = 40.5;

const z = ["hi"]; //var, let, and const all have the same meaning, they only define how the variable can be used/modified

```

Althought it seems easier that there is only 1-3 types of initializers, it confuses me sometimes because it is ingrained in my mind to use int, float, etc. from the other languages that I learned before.


## My Thoughts on JavaScript in Software Engineering

I think JavaScript is an excellent language to learn in a Software Engineering course. It's a very simple language to use at the top level and it is a powerful language that is widely used. Many apps today are written in JavaScript so I feel that being able to keep up with modern times and adding a language like JavaScript to my list of languages will benefit me in the future. 

## Athletic Software Engineering (WODs)

ICS314 is the first class that introduced the workout of the day (WOD). Essentially it is a timed question to help students think critically on the spot. I think it is an amazing idea and I think most programming classes should implement this type of learning. The WOD is very stressful but it can simulate an enviornment simular to one at a job interview where the interviewer wants to see you answer a question on the fly. For example I was watching a mock Google interview put up by Google themselves and the interviewer watned the interviewee to answer the question and see his critical thinking process. I feel like the WOD can simulate this process extremely well and prepare people for future interviews.
