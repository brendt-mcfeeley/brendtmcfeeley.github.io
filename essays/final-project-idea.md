# Overview

The Problem : The Department of Engineering sends out too many daily emails to students about upcoming events, clubs, seminars (with guest speakers), fundraisers, scholarships (directed to engineering majors), and faculty forms. Students usually ignore a lot of the emails they get from the university because they think it's spam or not relevent to think and they miss out on a lot of important events and/or imformation. Also ICS students are not included in engineering emails so they can join the list.

The Solution : We will create an app centralizes all events organized by clubs and faculty and create a calender for pretty reasons. Club officers and faculty will have access to add, edit, and remove events and information on the app. Anyone with a valid UH email will be able to register and get information for the app as well. Users will be able to "favorite" clubs or certain announcement and receive notifcations for the updates. The user will be able to RSVP via the app so there is an about accurate headcount of how many people will attend.

# Mockup Pages

* Public Landing Page
* Login Page
* User Homepage
* Admin Homepage (general)
* Club Admin Homepage
* Calender
* Chronological list of events coming up 
* FAQ

# Case Ideas

* New User goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile
* Admin page, logs in, adds event, checks food box (if food or no food)
* User goes to landing page, clicks drop down menu for FAQ, list of events, calender
* User logs in, adds favorite clubs, gets notification from their favorites

# Beyond the Basics

There will be a symbol on the calender for food. Events that will have food will have a little icon next to them to let students know they're worth going to. Also we will organize events by colors according to whether they're a speaker, general meeting, etc.
